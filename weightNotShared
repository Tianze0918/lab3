    WRN   This kernel exhibits low compute throughput and memory bandwidth utilization relative to the peak performance 
          of this device. Achieved compute throughput and/or memory bandwidth below 60.0% of peak typically indicate    
          latency issues. Look at Scheduler Statistics and Warp State Statistics for potential reasons.                 

    INF   The ratio of peak float (fp32) to double (fp64) performance on this device is 32:1. The kernel achieved 18%   
          of this device's fp32 peak performance and 0% of its fp64 peak performance. See the Kernel Profiling Guide

    WRN   The memory access pattern for global loads in L1TEX might not be optimal. On average, this kernel accesses    
          4.0 bytes per thread per memory request; but the address pattern, possibly caused by the stride between       
          threads, results in 6.1 sectors per request, or 6.1*32 = 195.4 bytes of cache data transfers per request.     
          The optimal thread address pattern for 4.0 byte accesses would result in 4.0*32 = 128.0 bytes of cache data   
          transfers per request, to maximize L1TEX cache performance. Check the Source Counters section for             
          uncoalesced global loads.

    WRN   The memory access pattern for loads from L1TEX to L2 is not optimal. The granularity of an L1TEX request to   
          L2 is a 128 byte cache line. That is 4 consecutive 32-byte sectors per L2 request. However, this kernel only  
          accesses an average of 2.1 sectors out of the possible 4 sectors per cache line. Check the Source Counters    
          section for uncoalesced loads and try to minimize how many cache lines need to be accessed per memory         
          request.

    WRN   Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 6.3 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 8 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of    
          7.95 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 0.60 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps    
          are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible   
          warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of      
          eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp.          
          Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------- ------------------------------
    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 42.9 cycles being stalled waiting for the local/global            
          instruction queue to be not full. This represents about 86.2% of the total average of 49.7 cycles between     
          issuing two instructions. Typically this stall occurs only when executing local or global memory              
          instructions extremely frequently. If applicable, consider combining multiple lower-width memory operations   
          into fewer wider memory operations and try interleaving memory operations and math instructions.
